# ArduinoCrashCourse
This repo contains the code and wiring diagrams for all of the projects from the OU ACM Arduino Crash Course.  These are all meant to be simple, fun, and easy Arduino projects for beginners or those who want a simple starting point to build a new project.  

For those of you who attended, we hope that you had fun and learned a lot!!! For those of you who weren't able to attend or have stumbled upon this lovely repo, we hope that our code/circuits help you with your projects and learning!!! Let us know if you have any questions.

All wiring diagrams are either a .png or .jpg image.  .ino is the file extension for Arduino IDE projects.


Happy making!!!! 
❤️ OU ACM



                                              ******Project Descriptions*****
  "Garduino": Soil moisture tracker! 
      Garduino prints out messages in the serial monitor to let you know if your plant's soil moisure levels are A-okay, or if it's time       to water!!! Try adding a temperature sensor, or maybe even an irrigation system to Garduino!  Come up with a way other than serial       monitor to keep track of your plant.  Concept from http://www.instructables.com/id/Garduino-Gardening-Arduino/
     
  Hand-Controlled Servo: Control a motor with the movement of your finger.
      The hand-controlled servo project uses a flex sensor attached to a glove (or directly to your finger!) to control a servo motor.         How cool would this be if you made it wireless! Concept from 
      https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sik-experiment-guide-for-arduino---v32/all#experiment-9-using-a-flex-sensor
    
  The Best Hot Chocolate!: Know when your hot chocolate (or other hot beverages) are at the right temperature for drinking!
      The Best Hot Chocolate project uses a TMP36 temperature sensor and an RGB LED as an indicator to let you know when your hot drink       is at the optimal temperature for enjoyment, not too hot, not too cold (but eh...we're all different, so the best temperature may       vary...but that's why you have open source code from Github to play with!!!!!).
      
   Mood Light: Give the room an ever-changing hue with this light that changes color based on the amount of ambient light in the room!
      The Mood Light project uses a photoresistor to control an RGB LED.  As the room fills with light, the LED gets brighter with       
      colors like yellow and light blue.  As the room gets darker, the LED turns dark hues of red, blue, and purple.
   
   Piezo Piano: Make a mini musical instrument.
       The Piezo Piano uses piezo buzzers and push buttons to make a piano-like instrument that can play 8 notes!  Try replacing the            buttons with touch sensors.  If you really want a challenge, try making visual art by mapping the piezo sounds into an image!

   Reaction Timer: Test your speed with this fun game!
        The Reaction Timer project is a game made from two green LEDs, a red LED, and a push button.  Each LED lights up one at a time.         Your goal is to press the button when the red LED is on!  If you're successful, the game gets faster! If you press a green LED,         the game slows down.  Concept from https://adamcoster.com/2012/03/04/arduino-reaction-time-game/
        
   Simon Says: Enjoy this classic game!
        Can you keep up? This game uses LEDs, push buttons, and a piezo buzzer to create the classic game of Simon Says.  The LEDs light         up in different patterns.  Your goal is to follow each pattern exactly by pressing the buttons in the same pattern as their    
        corresponding LEDs.  Concept from http://www.kreativekiste.de/arduino-senso-simon-says-4-led-bauanleitung
